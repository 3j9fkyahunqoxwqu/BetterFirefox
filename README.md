# BetterFirefox

The goal of this project is to create a community based wishlist - which can also be used as a communication platform to get Mozilla Firefox again on the right course. Mozilla can use this to ***improve their own product***; it is up to them to work with. We would like to hear more from the Mozilla team!

## What is wrong with Firefox?

* Firefox needs a distinct own identity.
* Don't kill the engine or the theming ability.
* WebExtensions will replace Firefox’s powerful extension framework; why not add a workaround for both?
* The default search-engine is horrible and (if Google) is actually based on a competitor, also a web browser maker [ [that actually pays for its inclusion](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mozilla+search+engine+money) ] (Why not DuckDuckGo or StartPage?)
* [Give us back the control](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/04/save-firefox) over the browser and keep it clean and slim as much as possible (also less RAM usage then).
* Give us a setup which allow us to opt-in in the things we want and stop pre-installing stuff like the 'Hello' and 'Pockets' clients.
* Bloat like Pocket has been added. To our knowledge, this is a third-party extension that has been added and uses non-Mozilla servers to store data. Things like this should be left as extensions.
* Google's 'safe-browsing' mechanism is by default enabled, let the user decide to use it or not, each visited page otherwise will be sent back to Google, [some user not want to support this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox#Criticism). 
* Google's 'safe-browsing' mechanism creates cookies on everyone's system. Mozilla claims these cookies are separate but the UI makes no indication of this.
* No ability to sync all about:config tweaks (you need extra opt-in for that).
* Ability to reset about:config related changes on per-app/extension basis.
* [Increase the security](https://it.slashdot.org/story/16/02/12/034206/pwn2own-2016-wont-attack-firefox-because-its-too-easy) and adapt faster changes, especially to known reported issue like certificate frauds.
* Fix [known vulnerabilities](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/known-vulnerabilities/) much faster (asap [if possible]). Or have [sponsorship programs](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2016/06/09/help-make-open-source-secure/) so that others find/fix them.
* NoScript / uMatrix or uBlock's function could be adopted (or ask/work directly with the developers) to implement it directly since all of the extensions are today 'a must'. Tor Browser showed how it could look, with security sliders and options for 'advanced users'.
* Full support for the Vulkan API on Windows/Linux/MacOS to take advantage of graphics acceleration.
* 'Full sync' not only partial. Some addons/configs create own entries and they not getting synced as long you not explictiy opt-in + FF should get an option to backup/restore the default prefs based on browser version. 


## What is good?

* Security tests such as [seperated and isolated online identities](http://www.techtimes.com/articles/165830/20160618/mozilla-tests-firefox-containers-for-separate-online-identities.htm).
* That Mozilla [not needs Google anymore](http://www.cnet.com/news/firefox-maker-mozilla-we-dont-need-googles-money-anymore/)
* The theming/customization ability 
* Entire tweaking stuff (aka about:config)
* The [current extensions interface](http://www.ghacks.net/2016/06/09/why-firefox-will-continue-to-lose-market-share/)
* The Tab-System is pretty good and easy to use - especially for beginners
* Generally fast web page downloads (compared to other Browsers)
* Private browsing allows user to surf the internet without recording history or cookies (partial)
* Security, several mechanism are added (but still not as good as it could be)
* It's a developer friendly platform (Jetpack/SDK extensions) around the Browser, Extensions and eMail-program
* Integrated 'Reader Mode' for .pdf files
* Password management and the ability to sync (you also can set-up your own sync sever)
* Mostly all standards are supported, such as JavaScript, HTML (HTML5), MathML, PNG, SVG, XHTML, and XML,...
* Still Supports Microsoft Windows XP and theoretically even older systems (backward compatibility) while Chrome not supports it
* [An official roadmap](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Roadmap) is avaible, whish shows upcoming changes.
* Full support for HTTP/2 and TLS 1.3.


## Firefox vs. Chrome 

* Why use Firefox over Chrome, we didn't want another fork! Mozilla would probably argue that Firefox is unique because it’s made by a non-profit company dedicated to making the web better, rather than big for-profit corporations with their own agendas. It also uses Gecko, a different rendering engine, which hopefully helps preserve web standards through a variety of implementations.
