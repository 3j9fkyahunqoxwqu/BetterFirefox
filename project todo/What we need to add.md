* Proper build status (travis not working yet)
* Basic spell checking (maybe also via travis to avoid mistakes)
* Or maybe replace travis with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)?
* More content for the 'front-page' + explanations as detailed as possible 
* Once we got real content may introduce the gh-page 
* Maybe a Wiki?
* Community submitted wishes... 
* Add fancy graphics ^^ (low-prio)
* Organisation donation system
